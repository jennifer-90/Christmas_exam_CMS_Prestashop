### Overview

<span style="color:#B22222">**Three delivery methods in
Belgium**</span>  
   
With Shipping Manager, you integrate our three delivery methods directly
into your online shop, so your customers are able to choose the one they
prefer.
-   **To a private address**: such as home, office or a family member.
-   **To one of our 1250 pick-up points**: post offices or post points
    like supermarkets (Delhaize, Spar), bookshops (Press Shop, Relay),
    service stations (Total, Q8) and neighbourhood stores.
-   **To one of our 150 parcel lockers**: ideally situated in high
    footfall locations, stations and shopping centres.

  
<span style="color:#A52A2A">**Simplifying your logistics**</span>  
   
With the Shipping Manager, your customers select their delivery method
when they place their order online. You just need to take care of the
practical aspects.
-   **Follow-up and preparation** of your parcels
-   Creation of **shipping and return labels**, both domestic and
    international
-   **Management** of parcels shipments
-   **Tracking**  of your parcels

   
This add-on is available for free to all customers who have a signed
parcels contract with bpost.
